<span style="color:blue">Automated Google Workspace Blog Updates in Google Chat</span>

**Introduction:**
As a member of a Google Workspace Chat Group (GAM for Google Workspace), I noticed the introduction of a bot and became intrigued by its functionality. Unable to find an existing addon or app with similar features, I decided to develop my own bot, inspired by the existing one. While acknowledging the existence of other solutions, I embarked on this personal endeavor.

**Objective:**
Expand your knowledge of Google Workspace Updates. Through the power of Apps Script and Webhooks, I have created a seamless integration that automatically publishes new blog/feed posts from the Google Workspace Updates Blog to a dedicated Google Chat Space. Stay informed about the latest features, enhancements, and announcements related to Google Workspace with real-time notifications delivered directly to your Chat Space. Stay ahead of the curve and maximize your productivity with this convenient and efficient way of staying informed.

**Setup:**
Using this Bot/App is simple. It involves a single Apps Script project and file. Start by manually creating the script, copying and pasting the code, changing the Chat Room URL (chatWebhookUrl), and setting up a webhook in Google Chat or any other configured channel. The script will be triggered automatically at specified intervals (X hours) to perform its designated tasks. Remember to create a time-based trigger for the script.

**Conclusion:**
By developing a custom Google Chat bot/app using Apps Script and webhooks, you can greatly enhance your experience of staying updated with the latest posts from the Google Workspace Updates Blog. Automating the process of retrieving and sharing new content in real-time saves time and ensures important updates are readily available to your team or community. Explore the possibilities of Apps Script for creating your own custom integrations. Start your coding journey and create!

P.S. You can't publish webhooks on the Google Workspace Marketplace. Webhooks aren't conversational. They can't respond to or receive messages from users or events from Google Chat. Incoming webhooks work in direct messages, but only when all users have Chat apps enabled.
