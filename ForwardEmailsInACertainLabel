// a time-based trigger was added on this script to run every 30 mins
// the goal was to forward certain emails that i couldn't apply a filter on to be forwarded to one recipient 
// and i couldn't add a filter to keep someone in cc or bcc in all my emails so this was an easier way to do the required

function autoForward() {
  var recipient = 'usr@domain.com'; 
  var threads = GmailApp.search('label:sent-forwarded'); //search gmail and get the threads in the Label that will have the emails to be forwarded
  var myLabel = GmailApp.getUserLabelByName('Sent Label 2 Back'); //where emails will be moved to know that they were forwarded
  var myLabel2 = GmailApp.getUserLabelByName('Sent Forwarded');
  for (var i = 0; i < threads.length; i++) { // loop the threads
    var thisThread = threads[i];    
    var messages = thisThread.getMessages();

    thisThread.addLabel(myLabel); // move to label2
    thisThread.removeLabel(myLabel2); // remove from label 1
